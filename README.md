                            and for the "amountofwords" variable you should use None which will add 210 by defualt 
                            the reason why is if you go more than X number of wmp the site will know that it is for sure 
                            a bot 210 is not that number but it is a good number to work with once it finshs typing there
                            will be left time on the clock so you can slowly or fastly type the remaning words you don't
                            have to type any words you can just wait for the timer to finsh the count down but you should
                            type at list one word very slowly so that it wont say you where AFKing and stuff
